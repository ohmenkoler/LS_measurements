#### Pure sine wave
#### Stepped sines

### Multitone signals

### Swept sines
#### Linear
#### Logarithmic

## Oscilloscope

## Spectrum analyser

## Non-linearity estimation

# Device I use to develop this project

## Hardware

### Sound cards
For now I have a RME FireFace UC, I'll try it with a Presonus AudioBox USB.

## Software
I code this with Python, a Matlab version might come someday.
